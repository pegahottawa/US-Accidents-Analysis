US Road Accident Analysis (2016-2023)

This repository contains an extensive analysis of road accidents in the United States from 2016 to 2023. The project aims to identify patterns and factors contributing to accident severity and rates, providing insights that could help in enhancing road safety measures.

Project Overview:

I investigate several aspects of road accidents, including the impact of environmental conditions, time factors, geographic locations, and traffic control features on accident severity and occurrence. The analysis seeks to answer critical questions such as:

How do different times of the day affect accident severity?

Are certain geographic regions prone to higher accident rates?

What role do weather conditions play in accident occurrences?

How do road types correlate with accident severity?

How do descriptions of accidents reveal common themes or factors contributing to their occurrence and severity?
